        <p>Those <em>hours</em> that with gentle work did <strong>frame</strong><br />
            The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell<br />
            Will play the tyrants to the very <strong>same</strong>,<br />
            And that unfair which fairly doth excel:</p>
        <p>For never-resting <em>time</em> leads <code>summer</code> <strong>on</strong><br />
            To hideous <code>winter</code> and confounds him there,<br />
            Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite <strong>gone</strong>,<br />
            Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:</p>
        <p>Then were not <code>summer's</code> distillation <strong>left</strong><br />
            A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<br />
            Beauty's effect with beauty were <strong>bereft</strong>,<br />
            Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.</p>
        <p>But flowers distilled though they with <code>winter</code> <strong>meet</strong>,<br />
            Leese but their show, their substance still lives <strong>sweet</strong>.</p>
