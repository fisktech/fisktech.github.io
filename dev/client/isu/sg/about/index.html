                        <h2 class="redText mobileTitle">About SG</h2>
                        <p>We serve students and improve the student experience through advocacy and empowerment. Student Government is the student organization which represents all students at Iowa State University. To do this, we work with other student organizations, ISU administration, the Ames community, the state legislature, and the Board of Regents to accomplish initiatives, set policies, and make sure students have a voice.</p>
                        <h3>SG Structure</h3>
                        <p>SG is made up of 3 branches: executive, legislative, and judicial, just like the United States Government. Each branch is separate and performs its own specific duties, but also works with the other branches to make up SG as a whole.</p>
                        <h3>Roles of the Three Branches</h3>
                        <p>The <a href="../directory/index.html?q=Executive">executive branch</a>, which is made up of the President, Vice-President and <a href="../directory/index.html?q=Cabinet">cabinet</a>, works on specific projects and initiatives related to student interests. The legislative branch, which is made up of the <a href="../directory/index.html?q=Senators">Senate</a>, debates student issues and passes legislation regarding funding for student organizations. Finally, the judicial branch, which is made up of the <a href="../directory/index.html?q=Supreme%20Court">9-member Supreme Court</a>, rules on issues between students and student organizations.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h2 class="redText">Executive Branch</h2>
                        <h3>President of the Student Body</h3>
                        <p>The President of the Student Body is the chief executive of the Government of the Student Body and the official representative of the students of Iowa State University to the university administration, as well as the local, state, and federal governments. The President is elected by all students and serves a one-year term.</p>
                        <h3>Vice President of the Student Body</h3>
                        <p>The Vice President is the primary advisor to the President and serves as the representative of all students in the absence of the President. The Vice President also serves chairs Senate meetings and supports the efficient administration of the government. The Vice President is elected by all students and serves a one-year term.</p>
                        <h3>Executive Cabinet</h3>
                        <p>The Executive Cabinet is a close group of advisors to the President and develops and executes policy initiatives to advance student interests. Cabinet officers are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h2 class="redText">Legislative Branch</h2>
                        <p>All legislative powers and authority of the SG are vested in the Senate. Members of the Senate are elected for one year terms. Elections are held in March, with the new Senate taking over legislative powers in April. Senate members allocate student fee money by passing bills. They also ratify contracts and agreements negotiated by the SG by a two-thirds vote. Students are encouraged to talk to their Senators about suggestions and ideas that would help students at ISU. Senate meetings are held every Wednesday night (with the exception of academic breaks, dead week and finals week) at 7pm in the Campanile Room of the Memorial Union. Meetings are open to the public, and students are encouraged to attend. To learn more about specific members and to find contact information for your Senator, <a href="../directory">view the directory</a>.</p>

                        <h2 class="redText">Judicial Branch</h2>
                        <h3>Role of the Supreme Court</h3>
                        <p>The Supreme Courtâ€™s main job is to decide cases involving registered students of Iowa State University. This includes grievances filed by individual students and student organizations, including SG. One other role of the Supreme Court is to enforce and interpret the SG constitution, and determine the constitutionality of actions taken by either the executive or legislative branches. SG Supreme Court Justices also make up nine of the ten SG Presidential appointments to the All-University Judicial Board. This board hears cases involving violations of the student disciplinary regulations and student handbook.</p>
                        <h3>Composition of the Court</h3>
                        <p>The Supreme Court is made up of nine individual undergraduate and/or graduate students. The Court is comprised of one Chief Justice, who is the principal administrator of the body, and eight Associate Justices. In order for students to be seated on the Court, they must be nominated by the SG President and confirmed by the SG Senate. Once seated, they may remain on the Court until resignation, graduation, or termination of student status at Iowa State University.</p>
                        <h3>Rules</h3>
                        <p>The court operates in compliance with the SG Constitution and Bylaws, and within the boundaries of the Rules of the Court. <a href="../resources/index.html?q=Rules%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court">View the Rules of the Court</a>.</p>
